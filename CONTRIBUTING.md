Contributing to FarmAnimalsAlarm

Thanks for your interest in contributing! A few guidelines to get started:

- Please open an issue before major work to discuss the approach.
- Keep functions small and focused. Add tests for new behaviors.
- Follow PEP8 coding style. Use black/isort if you prefer.
- Use the `src/` package for library code and keep GUI scripts in `app/`.
- Put large datasets or model weights in `models/` and avoid committing them.

Pull request checklist:
- [ ] Tests added (if applicable)
- [ ] Lint passes
- [ ] Documentation updated
